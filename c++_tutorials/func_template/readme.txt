This folder demonstrates the function templates.

main.cpp --> obviously the main function.

NOTE: Here since we are using the same class template, we are directly calling the function without explicitly giving the arguments. Otherwise it wouldbe as follows:
<function_name> "<template>" (<arguments list>);
